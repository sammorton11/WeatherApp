# WeatherApp

This is my first Android application that connects to the internet and retrieves data from an API using a GET request. The app is a simple weather tool that displays the current weather based on the users location and displays the sunrise and sunset times. I implemented a refresh button in the action bar to refresh the weather data, as well as Celsius and Fahrenheit buttons to convert the temperature data to the users preference. I am still working on finishing testing as I am still learning Espresso and JUnit.



Technologies:

- Kotlin - Programming Language
- Retrofit - Library used to connect the application to the internet
- Dexter - Library used for permission requests
- OpenWeather API - API used to retrieve weather data -- https://openweathermap.org/api


Launch:

- minimum SDK - 21
- targeted SDK - 32
